## What is a data dictionary?

A data dictionary is a "manual" accompanying a data source or data set.

Its main purpose is to provide the reader information about:

* information on points of contact in relation to the data, e.g., data stewards, data owners
* information on the content of the data, most importantly:
    * provenance of the data: how obtained, how sampled, collection purpose
    * interface concerns, if a data source, e.g., use of APIs
    * optimally, full technical specifications of files, formats, interfaces, etc
* further information relevant to use of the data, e.g., "getting started" tutorials, legal considerations (licenses)

## Example data dictionaries

Data dictionaries can be written in formulaic ways. Typical sections:

* header with versions and register of changes
* a summary of data steward, owner, usage
* a high-level description of the content
* a detail description of the tables (or interfaces)

Data version management tools such as dvc facilitate programmatic updates
and curation of data registers.

An example follows.
